# randomizer
Simple randomizer python script

## Intro
Hi I'm Peyton, this is my first public Git repo. I'm a web dev by trade but just needed this implementation and wanted to make it myself. 

## Catalyst
I have a group of people that are interested in playing Magic: The Gathering. I bought a big box of Jumpstart packs and am going to use this to randomize the pick order. Simple stuff
